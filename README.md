# Faithful 32
Faithful 32 for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. This is a fork of discontinued Faithful project for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Win10, Android, iOS) by LukasPlaysGames probably due to Faithful now available on Marketplace

The reason that i continue this is becuase i hate the idea of buying stuff and a game that i already bought in the first place.
