# Faithful BE
Faithful BE, a port of Faithful for Bedrock Edition. This is a fork of discontinued Faithful project for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Win10, Android, iOS) by LukasPlaysGames probably due to Faithful now available on Marketplace

The reason that i continue this is becuase i hate the idea of buying stuff on a game that i already bought in the first place.

### Downloading
